### Getting started  

 First clone the repo, cd into the `nc-news` directory (inside the repo directory). From there run `npm install`. 
 To run the front end locally use `npm start`.
 To build a production app, use `npm run build` and when ready deploy to your selected host, instructions will vary from this point so check with your hosting provider.
